The automatic offset extractor for the CON file doesn't work, so you still need to manually extract the save data using Horizon, Le Fluffie, or another tool.

I made a very simple GUI to make it easier to use. It doesn't check which gems you already have unlocked.
â€” you can just click to unlock them all.
